## *What does this program do?*

This program aims to help people who work out in the gym, to help them enter the various exercises they perform on their phone, keep track of the exercises, the time spent on each session, the frequency of sessions over time, and to obtain statistics and diagrams of repetitions performed, after a certain amount of time.

## *Why is this project useful?*

I need a program tailored to my needs: easy to use, with quick entries (adding the exercise performed after each group of reps), and with the great advantage of evolving as my bodybuilding practice progresses.

## *How do I get started?*

This program is a .NET Maui project. After cloning, it can be opened in Visual Studio Visual Studio Code, or Jetbrains Rider, compiled and installed on an Android phone connected via USB or Wifi to the computer.

The current practice is to add a type of exercise, with possible difficulties (weight/time), then add a session and add exercises to this session.

## *Where can I get more help, if I need it?*

Please note that this program is still in its infancy.Here is one mail you can send a message to: [osainteve.sportproject.com](osainteve.sportproject.com).
